**Q: What is \(Const.appName)?**
A: \(Const.appName) is an AI-powered app designed to help fighters improve their muay thai jab technique by providing real-time feedback.

**Q: How should I position myself for the best results in \(Const.appName)?**
A: For optimal feedback, ensure your full body is visible in the camera, ideally no more than 8 feet away. Position the camera at chest level, and angle your body 30 degrees toward the camera in a well-lit indoor space with minimal background clutter.

**Q: Why does the app recommend facing the camera at 7 degrees?**
A: A slight 7-degree turn allows the app’s computer vision model to capture your form in a way that emphasizes key aspects of technique, like hip rotation, arm extension, and foot positioning.

**Q: How important is lighting and background for accurate analysis?**
A: Proper lighting is essential for the AI to recognize your movements accurately. Record in a well-lit room, and avoid cluttered backgrounds, as this can interfere with the app’s ability to detect your body position.

**Q: Why might the app fail to analyze my punches correctly?**
A: The app’s analysis can be affected by poor lighting, excessive background distractions, being too far from the camera, or positioning that obscures body parts like your wrists, hips, or feet.

**Q: Can I do other strikes than the jab?**
A: This app only gives feedback on the muay thai jab today. Request which strike you want us to add next in the feedback section.

**Q: Can \(Const.appName) replace a professional coach?**
A: While \(Const.appName) provides AI-driven feedback to enhance your training, it’s not a replacement for a professional coach, who can offer in-depth guidance and hands-on adjustments.

**Q: How do I upload videos or images to \(Const.appName)?**
A: That feature is coming soon. For now you have to record a new jab in real time.

**Q: Who can I contact for support or feedback?**
A: For support requests or feedback, feel free to reach out to us at julian@form-fighter.com. We're here to assist you with any questions or concerns.
